	import sys
	sys.stdout.write('.')

You may also need to call

sys.stdout.flush()
to ensure stdout is flushed immediately.

Python 2.6+
From Python 2.6 you can import the print function from Python 3:

from __future__ import print_function
This allows you to use the Python 3 solution below.

Python 3
In Python 3, the print statement has been changed into a function. In Python 3, you can instead do:

print('.', end='')
This also works in Python 2, provided that you've used from __future__ import print_function.

If you are having trouble with buffering, you can flush the output by adding flush=True keyword argument:

print('.', end='', flush=True)
share
