How do I open a file from the Terminal into MacVim's current window?

   [13]Andrew Stewart online
   Hello,
   Following up on my question yesterday, how do I open a file from the
   Terminal into MacVim's current window?
   For example, let's say I have various splits open onto various buffers
   in MacVim; I go to the Terminal and type `mvim README`.  I expect to
   see the file README loaded into the Vim-window I was working in before
   I switched to the Terminal.  I actually see the file README loaded
   into a whole new MacVim-window.
   I have set the MacVim preference "Open files from applications" to "in
   the current window and set the arglist".  This give the behaviour I
   want when double-clicking in the Finder -- but doesn't for the
   Terminal.
   Any ideas?
   Thanks and regards,
   Andy Stewart

   Aha: making use of the above, I can get the result I want.  In the
   Terminal:
       $ open "mvim://open?url=file:///path/to/file"
   And this respects the MacVim preference.
   If there's a more direct way I'd like to hear it...but for now this
   will do.

   If you have the above preference set it is enough to simply use:
   open -a MacVim.app filename1 filename2
   etc.
   If you have several windows open and want to specify which one to open
   a file in you need to use the --remote and --servername arguments to
   the "mvim" script (see ":h mvim"), e.g.
   mvim --servername VIM --remote filename
   (The server name can be gleaned from the window title.)

   Oh yes, so it does.
   So to summarise, given a MacVim instance in the background, and focus
   in the Terminal:
   * `open -a MacVim.app filename1` will open filename1 in the existing
   MacVim window.
   * `mvim filename1` will open filename1 in a new MacVim window.
   Presumably the mvim URL handler opens in the existing (rather than a
   new) MacVim window because it wraps the `open -a` mechanism?

   That's useful to know, thank you.

   Yes, using the "open" is like opening from Finder.
   MacVim works like this: each window runs its own Vim process.  Opening
   a file from Finder results in the MacVim app getting a request to open
   a file (mvim:// handler requests also end up here).  At this point
   MacVim will look at your preferences and respect those.  When opening
   a file from Terminal (with "mvim") you are actually starting a new Vim
   process manually and this process connects to the MacVim app which
   responds by opening up a new window.  This is why "mvim" always opens
   a new window.  (Maybe this is too much information, but there you go.)

   On the contrary, it's good to know exactly how this all works.  Thanks

   for taking the time to type it all out.
   It makes perfect sense now.
