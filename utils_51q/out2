How do I open a file from the Terminal into MacVim's current window?

                     Hello,

                     Following up on my question yesterday, how do I open a
                     file from the
                     Terminal into MacVim's current window?

                     For example, let's say I have various splits open onto
                     various buffers
                     in MacVim; I go to the Terminal and type `mvim README`.
                      I expect to
                     see the file README loaded into the Vim-window I was
                     working in before
                     I switched to the Terminal.  I actually see the file
                     README loaded
                     into a whole new MacVim-window.

                     I have set the MacVim preference "Open files from
                     applications" to "in
                     the current window and set the arglist".  This give the
                     behaviour I
   [21]Andrew        want when double-clicking in the Finder -- but doesn't
   Stewart[22]online for the
                     Terminal.

                     Any ideas?

                     Thanks and regards,

                     Andy Stewart

                     Aha: making use of the above, I can get the result I
                     want.  In the
                     Terminal:

                         $ open "mvim://open?url=file:///path/to/file"

                     And this respects the MacVim preference.

   [29]Andrew        If there's a more direct way I'd like to hear it...but
   Stewart[30]online for now this
                     will do.

                      If you have the above preference set it is enough to
                      simply use:

   [36]BjÃ¶rn         open -a MacVim.app filename1 filename2
   Winckler[37]online
                      etc.

                      If you have several windows open and want to specify
                      which one to open
                      a file in you need to use the --remote and --servername
                      arguments to
                      the "mvim" script (see ":h mvim"), e.g.

                      mvim --servername VIM --remote filename

                      (The server name can be gleaned from the window title.)

                     Oh yes, so it does.

                     So to summarise, given a MacVim instance in the
                     background, and focus
                     in the Terminal:

                     * `open -a MacVim.app filename1` will open filename1 in
                     the existing
                     MacVim window.
                     * `mvim filename1` will open filename1 in a new MacVim
                     window.

                     Presumably the mvim URL handler opens in the existing
   [43]Andrew        (rather than a
   Stewart[44]online new) MacVim window because it wraps the `open -a`
                     mechanism?

                     That's useful to know, thank you.

                     Cheers,
                     Andy

                      Yes, using the "open" is like opening from Finder.

                      MacVim works like this: each window runs its own Vim
                      process.  Opening
                      a file from Finder results in the MacVim app getting a
                      request to open
   [51]BjÃ¶rn         a file (mvim:// handler requests also end up here).  At
   Winckler[52]online this point
                      MacVim will look at your preferences and respect those.
                       When opening
                      a file from Terminal (with "mvim") you are actually
                      starting a new Vim
                      process manually and this process connects to the
                      MacVim app which
                      responds by opening up a new window.  This is why
                      "mvim" always opens
                      a new window.  (Maybe this is too much information, but
                      there you go.)

                     On the contrary, it's good to know exactly how this all
   [58]Andrew        works.  Thanks
   Stewart[59]online for taking the time to type it all out.

                     It makes perfect sense now.
